	'info':'The term "Pro" relates to scripts that receive a "reasonable" amount of free money and are presented in a credible and realistic manner.  While this is quite subjective, there is a distinct difference between these and our "extreme" scripts.   Tho it can be a fine line.\n\nBWAI\'s goal has always been to provide the veteran player with a challenging 1v1 opponent for standard resource PRO-like maps. Ideally the computer should not cheat, but this is simply not possible utilizing SC\'s hardcoded internal Ai engine and the modification of scripts alone. Free resources are thus alloted to the computer to compensate for these inherit weaknesses. \n\nSome of these Ai\'s may be extremely difficult to some and some may even seem unbeatable under certain circumstances, but all will have high replayability and all fall within that limit of being a FAIR challenge. The makers of these scripts have varying ideas of what constitutes a stern test and the degree of difficulty can vary accordingly. Try them all!',\
