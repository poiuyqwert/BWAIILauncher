	'info':"BWAIWar is the product of several coders obsession to build the best non-cheating Ai vs. Ai script. What began in late 2004 with only 2 participants, has now evolved into a BWAI ritual and has been the backbone of BWAI.com. \n\nWith each new war, new blood arrives. CounterZerg, a deadly no-frills knockout punch ripped through BWAIWar2, while the sheer magnitude of Ashara's $Protoss emerged as the master script of BWAIWar3. Archon_Wing's total AI package brought new life to BWAI.com with its impressive BWAIWar4 performance.\n\nPyAI was practically born with this contest and stole the show with the bi-product EntropyII. How did we ever manage to live without it?\n\nNow with BWAI Launcher, setting up a challenge is a snap!  Our large databse of AI opponents only grows!  Your turn.\n\nDirections:\nhttp://www.broodwarai.com/index.php?page=bwaiwar4 for the latest official results, rules, and replays.",\
